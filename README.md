# Get_Spotify_Playlist
  Hey guys! 
  I am trying to get the track names of a playlist in Spotify so that I might be able to export playlist to Apple Music more easily. 
Here is the version I am working on but with many problems. 

# Problems
  ## Full Playlist
  With the Spotify Web Player required, the website only shows the first 30 songs in a playlist. 
  ## Track Authors
  Some tracks have multiple authors with makes it more difficult to identify all the authors of a song. And I am still working on it. 
# Apple Music Import
  Since I can extract the playlist track names, it might be able to add these songs to an Apple Music Playlist. Maybe I'll work on Shortcut later.
